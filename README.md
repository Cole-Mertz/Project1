KU Coding Bootcamp Project 1

Our goal is to use APIs to create multiple call request to pull information from multiple sources. In our site we are going to use OMDB API to pull movie information, mediaWiki API to pull actor photo information, as well as a video to show the trailer of the movie that is being searched.
